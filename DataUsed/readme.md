## **Building Permits Data (Reproducibility Handling)**

Due to the large size of the original Department of Buildings (DOB) permits file, the raw dataset is not required to reproduce the results in this project. Instead, a cleaned and filtered permits dataset is included in the repository and can be directly loaded into the analysis pipeline.
The cleaning process is fully documented to ensure transparency, while the reduced dataset allows the project to remain lightweight and reproducible across environments.
